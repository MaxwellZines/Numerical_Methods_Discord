Hello! My name is Maxwell, and I will be publishing content for the Mooc discord self-study of Numerical Methods. 

A bit about me: I am a TA for Numerical Methods at my university. I have the strongest background in Mathematica, but I am also conversational in MATLAB, C, Python,
and ASM. I will attempt to write the code for this course in as many languages as possible to accomodate programmers from a wide range of backgrounds.

I intend to cover a wide range of topics, from machine numbers and root-finding, to numerical differentiation and integration, to PDEs and computational probability. 
I will attempt to upload at least onelecture (with corresponding sample code) and one problem set every week.

This code is intended to be simple and easy to follow... Sometimes as the cost of computational efficiency and in dissregard for programming best practices. You should
know that the code is designed with simplicity, not efficiency, in mind. On your own, I highly encourage you to use run-time measurements and work on optimizing all
of the algorithms presented on this repository.

If you have any questions, comments, or concerns - feel free to post in the Discord. Also feel free to pull or fork this repository. All materials are written by me
and you may distribute/edit them for private or educational use.
